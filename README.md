### Project objectives

The main goal of the project is to create a parking assistant program that will primarily use the HC-SR04 sensor to measure the distance from the objects. In cooperation with it, it will also use PWM sound signaling, the sound of which will be escalated by the approaching object. Last but not least, we will also use LEDs built into our used Arty A7-35T board. The improvement of our project is a 4 digit 7 segment display, which will display the distance from the object in centimeters
